# IOT_HOME-AUTOMATION_PROJECT

I have to build a smart home automation system. This automation system that you build can be
integrated with almost all the lab appliances(fans,lights etc.) and can be used to control them remotely from any
part of the world.This system will have an Android Application . By using this app, you will be able to monitor
and control the lab appliances from anywhere in the world with ease.
For the same :

# 1. I have  develop an android application which will :

a) Send data to cloud: To set the control command for the appliances.

b) Receive data from cloud : To monitor the current status of the appliance.

c) Have the provision to add/remove appliances.

# 2. Develop Python application(for now to be deployed to RPI) :

a) To receive the data from cloud: To control the appliances based on the data read.

b) To send the data to cloud :To update the status of appliances.

c) To add/ remove appliance.
